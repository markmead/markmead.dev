# Making Shopify Better with Alpine JS [Part 1 - Getting Product Data]

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">This post is currently being written</Callout>

In this post we will go over two methods of getting product data from the Shopify API with Alpine JS.

If you've been using Dawn, the new open-source theme from Shopify that makes use of Shopify 2.0, you may have seen the following code.

```
<script type="application/json">
  {{ product | json }}
</script>
```

This will render the product data as JSON which we can then get via JavaScript.

```
JSON.parse(document.querySelector('[type="application/json"]').textContent)
```

This approach works great and is a new concept to me, so thanks Shopify ðŸ™Œ
