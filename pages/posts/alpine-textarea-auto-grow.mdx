There are a few approaches that you can take when creating a `<textarea>` that autogrows with the users input, but how can we recreate these with Alpine JS with clean, reusable code?

Let's take the standard JavaScript approach and translate it to Alpine JS.

```HTML
<textarea
  x-data="{
    resize: () => {
      $el.style.height = 'auto';
      $el.style.height = `${$el.scrollHeight}px`
    }
  }"
  x-init="resize()"
  @input="resize()"
></textarea>
```

However, this approach has its downsides, the most notable being all the extra complexity and bloat added to HTML. However, there's an easy fix for that, we can extract the logic to a reusable Alpine JS `x-data` context.

```HTML
<textarea x-data="grow"></textarea>

<script>
document.addEventListener("alpine:init", () => {
  Alpine.data("grow", () => ({
    init() {
      this.resize();
      this.$el.addEventListener("input", () => this.resize());
    },
    resize() {
      this.$el.style.height = "auto";
      this.$el.style.height = `${this.$el.scrollHeight}px`;
    }
  }));
});
</script>
```

Now we can add `x-data="grow"` to any `<textarea>` and keep the `Alpine.data("grow")` in the layout file within a `<script>` (as shown above) or in a JavaScript file.

There is one more solution...

We could use the Alpine JS plugin, [Alpine JS Textarea Autogrow](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-textarea-autogrow). Which I recently created ðŸ¥³

With this plugin we can use an Alpine JS directive `x-grow` to create the same autogrow functionality/effect that is achieved in the previous examples.

```HTML
<textarea x-data x-grow></textarea>
```

Before we end this blog post I need to make a PSA...

Replacing `<textarea>` with `<span contenteditable>` is not a solution for this functionality, please don't do that.

Seems obvious right? I've seen a developer with 20+ years of experience do this... Remember, we all have off days.
