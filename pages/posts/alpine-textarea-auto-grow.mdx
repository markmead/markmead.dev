There are a few approaches that you can take when you are creating a `<textarea>` that autogrows with the users input, but how can we recreate these in Alpine JS?

We could take the common JavaScript approach and translate that to Alpine JS like this.

```HTML
<textarea
  x-data="{
    resize: () => {
      $el.style.height = 'auto';
      $el.style.height = `${$el.scrollHeight}px`
    }
  }"
  x-init="resize()"
  @input="resize()"
></textarea>
```

However, this approach has its drawbacks, the most notable being all this extra complexity and bloat added to HTML. There's an easy fix for that tho, we can extract the logic to a reusable Alpine JS `x-data` context.

```HTML
<textarea x-data="grow"></textarea>

<script>
document.addEventListener("alpine:init", () => {
  Alpine.data("grow", () => ({
    init() {
      this.resize();
      this.$el.addEventListener("input", () => this.resize());
    },
    resize() {
      this.$el.style.height = "auto";
      this.$el.style.height = `${this.$el.scrollHeight}px`;
    }
  }));
});
</script>
```

Now we can add `x-data="grow"` to any `<textarea>` in the codebase and keep the `Alpine.data("grow")` in the layout file within a `<script>` (as shown above) or even in a JavaScript file.

There is one more solution... We could use the Alpine JS plugin, [Alpine JS Textarea Autogrow](https://github.com/markmead/alpinejs-textarea-autogrow).

With this plugin we can use an Alpine JS directive `x-grow` to create the same autogrow functionality/effect that can be achieved in the previous examples.

```HTML
<textarea x-data x-grow></textarea>
```

Before we end this blog post I need to make a PSA...

Replacing `<textarea>` with `<span contenteditable>` is not a solution for this functionality, please don't do that. Seems obvious right? I've seen a developer with 20+ years experience do this... Remember, we all have off days.
