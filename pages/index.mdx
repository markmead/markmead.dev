# Mark Mead

Hey, I'm Mark ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Web Developer working at [Neon Digital](https://www.neondigital.co.uk) and [GetCandy](https://www.getcandy.io).

I'm currently working on two open source projects for Tailwind CSS developers.

### ðŸ§± HyperUI

A collection of accessible and responsive components built with Tailwind CSS. All of the components have been written with minimal Tailwind CSS to keep the HTML easy to read.

- [HyperUI GitHub](https://github.com/markmead/hyperui)

### ðŸŽ¨ Hypercolor

A curated collection of beautiful Tailwind CSS gradients using the full range of Tailwind CSS colors. Easily copy and paste the code or save the gradients as an image.
